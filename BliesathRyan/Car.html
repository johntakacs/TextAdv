      <p id='description'>As George makes his way to his car that's in his garage through a crowd of mice, he notices that the mice ate his tires.  George cannot believe how his tires are just gone, and he then decides to escape out of his own house as he was worried that they would try to eat him.  At least George is alive.</p>
