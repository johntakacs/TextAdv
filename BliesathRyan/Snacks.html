      <p id='description'>After 2 hours, the mice did file out of George's garage to go after his giant stack of food he dumped on his kitchen floor.  As most of the mice take their first bite of the snacks, George takes action by getting them with his spatula.  He was able to kill some of the mice, but the mice who lived pounced on George and brought him down to the floor.  They then killed George and decided to bury him outside in his backyard, and they did this by dumping the rest of George's snacks onto his body.  Maybe they should tell the animals to not eat the snacks if they don't want to see a dead body.</p>
