      <p id='description'>George had waited 5 hours straight to see if the mice would go after his Doritos stack by stack while also getting inpatient like he usually does with personal things.  After 5 hours had passed, George starts to see the mice come out of his garage and go after the Doritos.  As most of the mice were only able to take one bit of the Doritos, they get trapped in the mousetraps.  The mice that were not caught left George's garage and ran away while leaving the caught ones behind.  Maybe the ones who escaped will go after cheese next time.</p>
