      <p id='description'>George is in his home watching TV in his living room.  He's usually not fazed by the sounds he hears or the things he smells, but there was a rotten smell that made George pause the TV and walk to his garage where the smell was coming from.  He opens the door to the garage to see that there are mice everywhere, and they're trying to make a big home in his garage.  George wants to get rid of the mice, but how will he do it?</p>
