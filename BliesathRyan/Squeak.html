      <p id='description'>When George was speaking to the mice by squeaking at the mice for dear life, he at least was able to get them to settle and let his life be spared.  George failed to get the mice out of his garage and is now afraid to go back into his own home as he worried that the mice would take over his whole house, so he left his house and never came back as he now has a fear of mice.  Poor George.</p>
