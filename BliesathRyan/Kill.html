      <p id='description'>As George walks into his garage with his spatula, the mice seemed to notice that he was gonna try and kill them.  As a way to fightback, they quickly assembled themselves into an army and get rid of the spatula off his hands.  It didn't take long for him to let go of the spatula as soon as some of them pounced on it.  The mice then brought George to the floor, tied him up and held him hostage at his own home.  We can only hope the mouse exterminators will come to rescue him.</p>
