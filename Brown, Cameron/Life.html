      <h1 id='title'>Happily ever after</h1><br>
      <p id='description'>Fast forward a year and you are now the manager of the KFC you started at. Your life has become significantly better than what it was before moving out, as your mother is out of the equation and you are finally out of the trailer park. Having a steady flow of income and your own place has made you back into the man you were before the divorce. Not only that, you are now allowed to see your kids every three weekends. The status of your life has bettered by so much, putting you on a trail for happiness.</p>
